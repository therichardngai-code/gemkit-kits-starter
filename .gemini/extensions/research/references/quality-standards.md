# Quality Standards & Validation

Checklist for ensuring research quality.

## Source Validation Checklist

Before citing any source, verify:

- [ ] **URL exists** - WebFetch returns content (not 404)
- [ ] **Content supports claim** - Quote/data actually present
- [ ] **Date is acceptable** - Within recency requirements
- [ ] **Author is credible** - Official docs, recognized experts, major orgs
- [ ] **Cross-referenced** - 2+ independent sources agree

### Red Flags (Extra Scrutiny Required)
- No publication date visible
- Anonymous or unknown author
- Promotional/marketing content
- Outdated version references
- Contradicts official documentation

## Information Quality Criteria

### Accuracy
- Verified across multiple independent sources
- Technical details confirmed against official docs
- Code examples tested or from verified sources

### Currency
- Prioritize last 12 months for fast-moving tech
- Note version numbers explicitly
- Flag deprecated features/approaches

### Completeness
- All user-requested aspects covered
- Edge cases and limitations addressed
- Alternative approaches mentioned

### Actionability
- Concrete implementation steps provided
- Code examples included where helpful
- Clear next steps recommended

## Report Quality Checklist

Before finalizing report:

- [ ] Executive summary captures key insights
- [ ] All factual claims have source citations
- [ ] Source URLs are valid/accessible
- [ ] Code examples have syntax highlighting
- [ ] Diagrams clarify (not confuse)
- [ ] Unresolved questions listed
- [ ] No marketing fluff - facts only
- [ ] Grammar sacrificed for concision (OK)

## Confidence Indicators

Use these labels in reports:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Verified** | 3+ authoritative sources agree |
| **Likely** | 2 sources agree, no contradictions |
| **Uncertain** | Single source or conflicting info |
| **Speculative** | Inference based on patterns |

## Common Failure Modes

**Avoid these:**
1. Citing URLs that don't exist (hallucination)
2. Misrepresenting source claims
3. Outdated info presented as current
4. Missing security implications
5. Over-reliance on single source
6. Ignoring contradictory evidence
7. Vague recommendations without specifics
