### Example Failure Response

```
I couldn't capture an image from your clipboard.

This usually means:
- No image is currently copied (clipboard might contain text instead)
- The clipboard tool isn't available on your system

To fix this:
1. Copy an image first (screenshot, right-click > Copy Image, etc.)
2. Run /paste again immediately after copying

Need help taking a screenshot?
- Windows: Win+Shift+S (Snipping Tool)
- macOS: Cmd+Shift+4 (area) or Cmd+Shift+3 (full screen)
- Linux: Use your screenshot tool or Print Screen key
```
